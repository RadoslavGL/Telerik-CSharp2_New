//Write a program that reads an array of integers and removes from it a minimal number of elements in such a way 
//that the remaining array is sorted in increasing order. 
//Print the minimal number of elements that need to be removed in order for the array to become sorted.

//Input:
//On the first line you will receive the number N
//On the next N lines the numbers of the array will be given

//Output:Print the minimal number of elements that need to be removed
